# Setup Laravel Debugbar Documentation

This document describes the steps and changes made to install and configure Laravel Debugbar in this application.

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Install Laravel Debugbar
- **Command Run:**
  ```sh
  composer require --dev barryvdh/laravel-debugbar
  ```
  This adds Debugbar as a development dependency.

### 2. Register Debugbar Service Provider
- **File:** `bootstrap/providers.php`
- **Change:** Added `Barryvdh\Debugbar\ServiceProvider::class` to the providers array to register the Debugbar service provider.

### 3. Publish Debugbar Configuration
- **Command Run:**
  ```sh
  php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Barryvdh\Debugbar\ServiceProvider"
  ```
  This publishes the Debugbar configuration file to `config/debugbar.php` and creates the storage directory for Debugbar data.

### 4. Debugbar Configuration File
- **File:** `config/debugbar.php`
- **Change:** The published config file provides extensive options for enabling/disabling Debugbar, customizing collectors, storage, editor integration, and more. Default settings are used unless you modify the file.

### 5. Storage Directory for Debugbar
- **File:** `storage/debugbar/.gitignore`
- **Change:** Created to ensure Debugbar's storage files are not committed to version control, except for the `.gitignore` itself.

## Usage
- Debugbar will appear at the bottom of your application when `APP_DEBUG=true` and `DEBUGBAR_ENABLED` is not set to `false`.
- You can customize its behavior via `config/debugbar.php`.

## Troubleshooting
- If Debugbar does not appear, check that you are in a development environment and that Debugbar is enabled in the config.
- For more options, see the comments in `config/debugbar.php`.
