# City Resource Feature Documentation

This document describes the complete implementation plan for the City resource in the Filament application, including database layer, model, factory, seeder, and Filament resource components with proper relationship to Province.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Database Migration
- **File:** `database/migrations/[timestamp]_create_cities_table.php`
- **To Create:** New migration to create the `cities` table with:
  - `id` (auto-incrementing primary key)
  - `province_id` (foreign key referencing provinces table)
  - `name` (string, indexed for performance)
  - `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps
  - Foreign key constraint with cascade on delete

```php
Schema::create('cities', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->id();
    $table->foreignId('province_id')->constrained()->onDelete('cascade');
    $table->string('name');
    $table->timestamps();
    
    $table->index(['province_id', 'name']); // Composite index for queries
});
```

### 2. City Model
- **File:** `app/Models/City.php`
- **To Create:** Eloquent model with:
  - HasFactory trait for factory support
  - Proper PHPDoc type hints for the factory
  - `$fillable` array containing `province_id` and `name` fields
  - BelongsTo relationship to Province model
  - Proper return type declarations

```php
class City extends Model
{
    /** @use HasFactory<\Database\Factories\CityFactory> */
    use HasFactory;

    protected $fillable = [
        'province_id',
        'name',
    ];

    public function province(): BelongsTo
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(Province::class);
    }
}
```

### 3. Update Province Model
- **File:** `app/Models/Province.php`
- **To Modify:** Add HasMany relationship to cities:

```php
public function cities(): HasMany
{
    return $this->hasMany(City::class);
}
```

### 4. City Factory
- **File:** `database/factories/CityFactory.php`
- **To Create:** Factory for generating test data:
  - Uses `Province::factory()` to create associated province
  - Uses `fake()->city()` to generate realistic city names
  - Proper PHPDoc annotations for type safety

```php
public function definition(): array
{
    return [
        'province_id' => Province::factory(),
        'name' => fake()->city(),
    ];
}
```

### 5. City Seeder
- **File:** `database/seeders/CitySeeder.php`
- **To Create:** Seeder with major Canadian cities:
  - Organized by province with realistic city data
  - Uses existing Province records (requires Province seeder to run first)
  - Includes major cities for each province

```php
$cityData = [
    'Alberta' => ['Calgary', 'Edmonton', 'Red Deer', 'Lethbridge'],
    'British Columbia' => ['Vancouver', 'Victoria', 'Surrey', 'Burnaby'],
    'Ontario' => ['Toronto', 'Ottawa', 'Hamilton', 'London'],
    // ... etc for all provinces
];
```

### 6. Update Database Seeder
- **File:** `database/seeders/DatabaseSeeder.php`
- **To Modify:** Add `CitySeeder::class` after `ProvinceSeeder::class` to maintain proper order

### 7. Filament Resource Structure

#### Main Resource File
- **File:** `app/Filament/Resources/Cities/CityResource.php`
- **To Create:** Main resource class with:
  - Model binding to `City::class`
  - Navigation icon using `Heroicon::OutlinedBuildingOffice2`
  - Separated form and table configurations into dedicated classes
  - Standard resource pages configuration
  - Navigation group to organize with Province resource

#### Form Schema
- **File:** `app/Filament/Resources/Cities/Schemas/CityForm.php`
- **To Create:** Form configuration with:
  - Province selection using relationship() method
  - Required text input for city name
  - Maximum length validation (255 characters)
  - Composite unique validation (name + province_id combination)

```php
Select::make('province_id')
    ->relationship('province', 'name')
    ->required()
    ->searchable(),

TextInput::make('name')
    ->required()
    ->maxLength(255)
    ->unique(ignoreRecord: true, modifyRuleUsing: function (Unique $rule, $get) {
        return $rule->where('province_id', $get('province_id'));
    }),
```

#### Table Configuration
- **File:** `app/Filament/Resources/Cities/Tables/CitiesTable.php`
- **To Create:** Table configuration with:
  - ID column (sortable)
  - Province name column (searchable and sortable via relationship)
  - City name column (searchable and sortable)
  - Created/updated timestamps (toggleable, hidden by default)
  - Edit action for individual records
  - Bulk delete action for multiple records
  - Filters for province selection

```php
->columns([
    TextColumn::make('id')->sortable(),
    TextColumn::make('province.name')
        ->label('Province')
        ->searchable()
        ->sortable(),
    TextColumn::make('name')
        ->label('City')
        ->searchable()
        ->sortable(),
    TextColumn::make('created_at')->dateTime()->sortable()
        ->toggleable(isToggledHiddenByDefault: true),
    TextColumn::make('updated_at')->dateTime()->sortable()
        ->toggleable(isToggledHiddenByDefault: true),
])
->filters([
    SelectFilter::make('province_id')
        ->relationship('province', 'name')
        ->label('Province'),
])
```

### 8. Resource Pages

#### List Page
- **File:** `app/Filament/Resources/Cities/Pages/ListCities.php`
- **To Create:** List page with:
  - Create action in header
  - Extends `ListRecords` base class

#### Create Page
- **File:** `app/Filament/Resources/Cities/Pages/CreateCity.php`
- **To Create:** Standard create page extending `CreateRecord`

#### Edit Page
- **File:** `app/Filament/Resources/Cities/Pages/EditCity.php`
- **To Create:** Edit page with:
  - Delete action in header
  - Extends `EditRecord` base class

## Implementation Commands to Execute

```bash
# Create model with migration, factory, and seeder
php artisan make:model City -mfs

# Create Filament resource
php artisan make:filament-resource City

# Run migration (after implementation)
php artisan migrate

# Run seeder (after implementation)
php artisan db:seed --class=CitySeeder
```

## Features to Implement

1. **Full CRUD Operations:**
   - Create new cities with province association
   - Read/view cities in sortable, searchable table with province information
   - Update existing city names and province associations
   - Delete individual cities or bulk delete multiple

2. **Data Validation:**
   - Required province_id and name fields
   - Composite unique constraint (city name + province combination)
   - Maximum length validation (255 characters)
   - Foreign key constraint enforcement

3. **User Experience:**
   - Searchable table for easy filtering by city or province
   - Province filter for quick filtering
   - Sortable columns for better organization
   - Relationship-based province selection in forms
   - Toggleable timestamp columns for detailed information

4. **Data Relationships:**
   - Proper Eloquent relationships between City and Province
   - Efficient database queries using eager loading
   - Cascade delete when provinces are removed

5. **Data Seeding:**
   - Pre-populated with major Canadian cities
   - Properly associated with existing provinces
   - Factory available for generating test data

## Testing Considerations

For comprehensive testing, the following should be verified:

1. **Model Tests:**
   - Factory generates valid city data with proper province association
   - Model validation rules work correctly
   - Relationship methods return correct types
   - Composite unique constraint prevents duplicates

2. **Filament Resource Tests:**
   - CRUD operations function properly
   - Province relationship displays and functions correctly
   - Search functionality works for both city and province
   - Filter functionality works
   - Validation errors display correctly
   - Bulk actions work as expected

3. **Database Tests:**
   - Migration creates table with correct structure and constraints
   - Foreign key constraint works properly
   - Seeder populates expected data with correct relationships
   - Cascade delete works when provinces are removed

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements could include:

1. **Extended Relationships:**
   - Link cities to customer addresses
   - Add postal code/zip code support
   - Population data and city statistics

2. **Geographic Features:**
   - Latitude/longitude coordinates
   - Time zone information
   - Regional groupings

3. **Enhanced Functionality:**
   - Import/export capabilities
   - Bulk operations for city management
   - Advanced filtering and sorting options
   - City hierarchy (metropolitan areas, districts)

4. **Integration Points:**
   - Customer model relationship
   - Address validation
   - Geographic search capabilities
